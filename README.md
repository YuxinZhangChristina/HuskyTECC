# HuskyTECC
# AdaptiLab HireAssistant

The project will be to create a Google Chrome extension that allows users to easily apply to many jobs online with pre-filled information and provides users with recommendations for similar jobs. The chrome extension builds on an existing AdaptiLab product, a job recommender engine with an integrated web scraper that gathers data from online job boards. The chrome extension will call an API endpoint that receives organized data found by the existing product. The majority of the engineering work done for the Chrome extension will be customer-facing (e.g. making an intuitive and functional UI for candidates to interact with).

## Style Guide

### JavaScript

#### Style

JavaScript is written in [ES6](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) with Flow style static typing.

#### Format

Code should be formatted similarly to [Google JavaScript Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

For formatting this means:

- Block indents are +2 spaces
- Continuation indents are +4 space
- Tab character are not used
- Column limit (right margin) of 80 characters

Other formatting should also be consistent. It is worth noting that many IDEs (including WebStorm) can automatically reformat code.

#### Documentation

JavaScript classes and functions should be commented with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) style comments to help with documentation.

Not every tag needs to be used. The most important tags to use are:

- `@class`
- `@param`
- `@returns`

Comments should also have a brief description.

> Render methods do not need Flow annotations or `@returns` tags because typing is easily inferred and obvious to the reader.

### CSS

Sass is written using SCSS syntax.
